# Speech-Processing-Using-MATLAB-Project
Speech Processing Using MATLAB is a DSP project. Basically we are following the given below question step by step. 

In this Matlab problem you will see the effects of Decimation &amp; Interpolation on an audio signal. 
Record your speech of about 5 seconds at sampling frequency of 32 kHz. You can use either wavrecord() MATLAB function or windows sound recorder for this purpose. If you use Sound Recorder, then u need to first set its properties for recording sound at 32 kHz and single channel. 
1. Plot the time and frequency domain magnitude spectrums of this speech signal. (Use wavread() to read the speech signal. Use freqz() to plot the frequency spectrum). What is highest frequency of this signal? Play this signal using wavplay(). 
2. Decimate the signal by a factor of 2. Again plot the time and frequency domain spectrum of the signal. Play the sound. What do you observe? 
3. Again decimate the signal by a factor of 2. Plot the time and frequency domain spectrum of the signal. Play the sound. What do you observe? 
4. Now interpolate the signal by a factor of 2. Plot the time and frequency domain spectrum of the signal. Play the sound. What do you observe? 
5. Again interpolate the signal by a factor of 2. Plot the time and frequency domain spectrum of the signal. Play the sound. What do you observe?

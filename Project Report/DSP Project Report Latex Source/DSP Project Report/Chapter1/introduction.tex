Signals are time-varying quantities which carry information. They may be, for example, audio signals (speech, music), images or video signals, sonar signals or ultrasound, biological signals such as the electrical pulses from the heart, communications signals, or many other types. With the emergence of high-speed, low-cost computing hardware, we now have the opportunity to analyze and process signals via computer algorithms.\\

The basic idea is straightforward: Rather than design complex circuits to process signals, the signal is first converted into a sequence of numbers and processed via software. By its very nature, software is more easily extensible and more versatile as compared with hard-wired circuits, which are difficult to change. Furthermore, using software, we can build in more “intelligence” into the operation of our designs and thus develop more human-usable devices.

\section{Introduction}
\noindent Audio signal processing is the subfield of signal processing in which we work with the
audio or what we hear. Different objects produce sound like bird, engines, motors noise
in robotic systems. The human can hear these sounds but there is always a mixture of
some background noise in the audio signals that must be processed in order to
get the desire signals.

The audio sample is taken having some background noise or by adding noise by yourself,
then this audio sample is processed by analyzing it in MATLAB or any other tools. We
perform some operation of the signal, for more precisely analyzing the signals in
Frequency spectrum for analyzing in frequency domain in order to remove noise. Then a
filtered signal is produced at the output.

\subsection{Filters}
\subsubsection{Bandpass Filters}
A bandpass filter is an filter that allows signals between two explicit frequencies,
however that oppresses signals at different frequencies. Some bandpass channels
require an outer wellspring of intensity and utilize dynamic parts, for example,
semiconductors and coordinated circuits; these are known as dynamic bandpass filters.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.60]{Chapter1/bandPassFilter}
\caption{Band Pass Filter Frequency Response}
\label{bandPassFilter}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Band Stop Filters}
The Band Stop Filter, (BSF) is another variety of frequency selective circuit that
functions in just the other thanks to the Band Pass Filter we tend to checked out before.
The band stop filter, additionally referred to as a band reject filter, passes all
frequencies with the exception of these inside a such stop band that are greatly
attenuated.\\
Also, a bit like the band pass filter, the band filter may be a second-order (two-pole)
filter having 2 cut-off frequencies, normally referred to as the -3dB or half-power
points manufacturing a good stop band information measure between these 2 -3dB
points.\\
So for a wide-band band stop filter, the filters actual stop band lies between its lower
and higher -3dB points because it attenuates, or rejects any frequency between
these 2 cut-off frequencies. The frequency response curve of a perfect band stop filter
is so given as:

\label{stopBandFilter}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Low pass Filter}
A low-pass filter is a filter that permits signals under a cutoff frequency (known as the
pass band) and lessens signals over the cutoff frequency (known as the stop band). By
evacuating a few frequencies, the channel makes a smoothing impact. That is, the
channel delivers moderate changes in yield esteems to make it simpler to see patterns
and lift the general SNR with insignificant signal noise.
